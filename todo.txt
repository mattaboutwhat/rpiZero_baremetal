1. Make GPIO struct
	. can remove "extern uint* gpio" from "interrupts.c"!
2. Test "_disable_interrupts" function
3. Start on Mini UART controller!
4. Then what? MMC? DMA? SPI? GPU 2D?
	. SPI + DMA could become an LCD driver...
	. GPU 2D probably won't, unless we can output to something 
	  other than HDMI.
5. Porting an emulator (or simpler program) to it.




Things I wanna do:

 [ ] Set up Eclipse RPi Zero toolchain
	[ ] Hello world on ecplise
 [ ] go through one guy's rpi makefile
 [ ] fix systimer & uart interrupts


Uart steps:
	[ ]  0. Light the LED.
	[ ]  1. LED, sys- or arm-timer-driven interrupt toggle
			Needs:
				base
				interrupts
				armtimer OR systimer
				gpio
	[ ]  2. UART-driven interrupt LED toggle
	[ ]  3. UART echo
	[ ]  4. useful UART
